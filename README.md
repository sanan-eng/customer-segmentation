# ðŸ›’ Customer Segmentation using K-Means and DBSCAN

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project performs *customer segmentation* on the Mall Customers dataset using clustering algorithms.  
The goal is to group customers based on their *Annual Income* and *Spending Score* for better business insights.

We implemented:
- *K-Means Clustering* (with Elbow Method for optimal k)
- *DBSCAN Clustering* (with parameter tuning using k-distance graph)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- *File:* Mall_Customers.csv  
- *Source:* Kaggle (Mall Customers Dataset)  

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed
1. *Data Cleaning*  
   - Checked for null and duplicate values  
2. *Data Scaling*  
   - StandardScaler applied on Income & Spending Score  
3. *K-Means Clustering*  
   - Elbow method used â†’ Optimal k = 5  
   - Visualized clusters with centroids  
4. *DBSCAN Clustering*  
   - Tuned eps and min_samples  
   - Formed 3 clusters with 8 noise points  
5. *Bonus Analysis*  
   - Calculated *average spending score per cluster*  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- *K-Means* â†’ 5 customer clusters identified  
- *DBSCAN* â†’ 3 clusters + 8 noise points  
- *Average Spending per Cluster* calculated
